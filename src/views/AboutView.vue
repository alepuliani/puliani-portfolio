    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my life, I've explored various rolesâ€”working as a hostess, a
      shop assistant, and a nail technician. Each job taught me valuable lessons
      and provided meaningful experiences, yet I always felt like something was
      missing.<br />
      I've come to realize that I'm a very <strong>logical</strong> and
      <strong>practical</strong> person. <br />
      During my time as a nail technician, I discovered that what truly
      motivated me was the process of <strong>setting a goal</strong> and
      figuring out the best way to <strong>achieve it</strong>. <br />
      This drive for problem-solving and goal-oriented work ultimately led me to
      the world of <strong>web development</strong>, where I found the
      fulfillment I had been searching for.

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching films, and immersing myself
        in TV series. I'm particularly drawn to the worlds of
        <strong>fantasy</strong> and science fiction, captivated by the vastness
        of the universe and the mysteries it holds. <br />
        I also love spending time in <strong>nature</strong>, which fuels my
        passion for photography, allowing me to capture its beauty. <br />
        Environmental issues deeply concern me, especially their impact on both
        humanity and the animal world. <br />
        This drives me to adopt a <strong>sustainable lifestyle</strong> and
        actively support organizations and initiatives dedicated to addressing
        these critical challenges.
